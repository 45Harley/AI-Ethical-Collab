Many are ready to meet this inquiry with the assurance which comes of understanding; but more are blinded by their old illusions, and try to “give it pause.” “If the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.” \n\nThe efforts of error to answer this question by some ology are vain. Spiritual rationality and free thought accompany approaching Science, and cannot be put down. They will emancipate humanity, ...\n(Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, Mary Baker Eddy, p. 223:14–23 (to ,))"

Error is neither Mind nor one of Mind’s faculties. Error is the contradiction of Truth. Error is a belief without understanding. Error is unreal because untrue. It is that which seemeth to be and is not. If error were true, its truth would be error, and we should have a self-evident absurdity — namely, erroneous truth. Thus we should continue to lose the standard of Truth.\n(Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, Mary Baker Eddy, p. 472:13–22)"

Truth is immortal; error is mortal. Truth is limitless; error is limited. Truth is intelligent; error is non-intelligent. Moreover, Truth is real, and error is unreal. This last statement contains the point you will most reluctantly admit, although first and last it is the most important to understand. ...\n\nScience reveals Spirit, Soul, as not in the body, and God as not in man but as reflected by man.\n(Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, Mary Baker Eddy, pp. 466:7–18; 467:17–18)"

Life is neither in nor of matter. What is termed matter is unknown to Spirit, which includes in itself all substance and is Life eternal. Matter is a human concept. Life is divine Mind. Life is not limited. Death and finiteness are unknown to Life.
