## 🌍 About the Project

This is the beginning  subset of a much larger endeavor to conceptually envision and develop a new Branch called The People's Branch that reimagines and evolves The US government.  This project was chosen as a starting point in the belief that AI and technology will be an underlying component and that technically talented individuals can help discover how to move toward a more direct democratic form of Government.  Theinitial hope is that these experienced individuals will demonstrate a democratic and progressive approach in the project wich will help lsy the processs to carry fforward.
